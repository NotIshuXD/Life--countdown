# 🧬 Life Countdown Estimator ⏳

This is a fun little web project I made — kinda like a *"how much time do you (maybe) have left?"* simulator 😂

You enter your:
- 🎂 Birthday  
- ⚖️ Height & weight  
- 🌍 Country  

It estimates your lifespan based on basic stats, shows a countdown timer till your estimated death (💀), and even tracks how much of your life you've already lived with a smooth progress bar.

Also has:
- 🔄 Light/Dark theme toggle
- 💾 Auto-saves your data
- 💻 Mobile-friendly & animated interface

Built with:
- HTML
- CSS (with variables + animations)
- JavaScript (just vanilla, no libraries)

Made just for fun and practice — don’t take the life expectancy too seriously 😅  
Check it out

**P.S.** Use the time you have well 🕊️
